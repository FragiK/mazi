# mazi
mazi (μαζί) means "together" in greek. 
This repo aims to be a collaborative effort to find a viable solution to the Greek debt crisis.

### Disclaimer
**Neither this Repo nor it's creator belong to any political party**

Any contribution or comment is welcome as long as it is backed with arguments and free of political propaganda.

## Why this repo?

Greece has been in a state of [recession and crisis since 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_debt_crisis_timeline) . 
Negotiations between the Greek goverment and the Troika (aka "the institutions") have failed.
There will be a [Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_bailout_referendum,_2015) on on 5 July 2015 
asking greeks to say yes or no to a proposal of measures to be taken.
Whatever the outcome of the Referendum will be there will probably be further negotiations.

The scope of this repo is to modify the oficial proposals so that they have:
- positive effects on the greek economy.
- are acceptable from both the "Institutions" and the Greek goverment.
- have minimal negative effects on the lives of Greek people.
- carry minimal negative implications on people of other european countries.

This may sound impossible but at least we can try and do better than the oficial negotiators. 

## How does it work?
The European Commision has published on 28 June 2015 a [List of prior Actions](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-5270_en.htm). 

On the basis of this document we try to:

1. Understand what exactly is being proposed as well as the social end economic implications.
2. Gather data and information relevant to each action.
3. Evaluate the proposed actions. 
4. Modify the proposed actions.
5. Propose alternative actions to be taken.

## Examples:
Example 1:

>VAT reform
>...
>The new VAT system will: (i) unify the 
>rates at a standard 23 percent rate, which will include restaurants and catering, and a reduced 13 percent rate for 
>basic food, energy, hotels, and water (excluding sewage); and a super-reduced rate of 6 percent for pharmaceuticals, 
books, and theater;
>...

Here we could:
- Collect data about the current VAT rates in Greece and other European Countries
- Ask an expert or find literature to the effects of VAT adaptation
- Try to get data from the Greek Ministry of finance about goverment income from VAT
- Ask the European commission why their experts think this is a necessary action to be taken

Example 2:
> Privatization
> The government will transfer the state's shares in OTE to the HRADF.   

OTE is the Greek telecom Company. 
- Gather data about it's profitability and financial situation.
- How many shares does the Greek goverment has in OTE.
- What would be the estimated Revenue from selling these.

Example 3:
> Fiscal structure measures
> introduce tax on television advertisements;

- Check if television ads are indeed tax free (wow !!! )
- Somehow estimate the expected revenue
