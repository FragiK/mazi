# mazi
mazi (μαζί) means "together" in greek. 
This repo is a collaborative effort to find a minimum viable solution to the Greek debt crisis.

Greece has been in a state of recession and crisis since 2008. 
There will be a [Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_bailout_referendum,_2015) on on 5 July 2015 
asking greeks to say yes or no to a proposal of measures to be taken.

The scope of this repo is to modify the oficial proposals so that they have:
- positive effects on the greek economy
- are acceptable from both the "Institutions" and the Greek goverment
- have minimal negative effects on the lives of Greek people
- carry minimal negative implications on people of other european countries

This may sound impossible but at least we can try and do better than the oficial negotiators.
